# TiTsEd #

This project was a save editor for the Flash engine version of the game *Trials in Tainted Space*.

This project does *NOT* support the Javascript version of the game.

TiTsEd allows you to edit your character's stats, and possibly other things in the future.

## Requirements ##

Requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later, only officially tested and supported on Windows.


## Installation ##

[Download the latest `TiTsEd-*.zip` archive](https://github.com/algoRhythm99/TiTsEd/releases/latest "https://github.com/algoRhythm99/TiTsEd/releases/latest") from the releases tab (above) and extract the files wherever you want.  No installation required.  Note that browsing the archive via Windows Explorer is not sufficient, the files *must* be extracted from the archive or you will receive errors.
